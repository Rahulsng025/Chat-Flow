# Chat-Flow
A Real Time Chat Application Based on Socket.io, Node.js, Angular 10

## What is Web Socket? 
WebSocket is the internet protocol that allows for full-duplex communication between a server and clients. This protocol goes beyond the typical HTTP request and response paradigm. With WebSocket, the server may send data to a client without the client initiating a request, thus allowing for some very interesting applications.

*Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between that browser and the server. On the server side i have used node and express. For the client side I have used angular and socket.io-client npm package*
